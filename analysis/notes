Assumptions/Agreement
definition of a DDOS attack - what is it, how to identify the attach via the log entry data points


"Since a DDoS attack is an incredible amount of traffic sent to your server, you would see a spike
unlike any high-traffic day including your busiest times. As a matter of fact, the ideal time for
an attacker to strike is when you’re busy, because he can use the existing traffic as well as his
own to help crash the server."

so the technical problem would be to look for anlomalies in the daily traffic by observing traffic
trends

503 “Service Unavailable” status code can be returned by the server for a variety of reasons, but
it can be used as a way to detect DDOS

Challenges
parsing the log file entry to identify data points - example appears to be Apache log file format
